# 📄 .gitattributes Guide

The `.gitattributes` file is a powerful configuration file used in Git repositories to define how Git should handle specific files. It helps improve consistency across platforms, manage large files, and handle merge behavior.

## ✅ Purpose of `.gitattributes`

| Feature                      | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 🧹 **Line Ending Normalization** | Ensures consistent line endings (LF or CRLF) across operating systems. |
| 🛠️ **Merge Strategy Control**     | Custom merge behavior for specific file types. |
| 🖼️ **Binary File Declaration**    | Marks files as binary so Git doesn’t try to diff/merge them. |
| 📤 **Archive Control**           | Exclude files from `git archive` using `export-ignore`. |
| 📦 **Git LFS Integration**       | Track large files using Git Large File Storage. |
| 🧠 **Custom Diff Drivers**       | Define how Git compares changes in specific file types. |
