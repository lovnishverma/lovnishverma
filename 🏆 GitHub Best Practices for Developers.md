# üèÜ GitHub Best Practices for Developers

---

## 1. Use Meaningful Commit Messages

* Write clear, concise, and descriptive messages
* Follow the format:

  ```
  <type>: <short description>

  <optional detailed explanation>
  ```
* Examples:

  * `feat: add user login functionality`
  * `fix: resolve crash on app startup`
  * `docs: update README with installation steps`

---

## 2. Branching Strategy

* Use branches for features, fixes, experiments
* Common models:

  * **Git Flow**: `main`, `develop`, feature branches, release branches
  * **GitHub Flow**: simple branches off `main` and PRs
* Always branch off the latest stable branch

---

## 3. Pull Requests (PRs)

* Use PRs to review code before merging
* Add meaningful descriptions and link related issues
* Review and test changes thoroughly
* Use PR templates for consistency
* Require approvals before merging

---

## 4. Keep Branches Up to Date

* Regularly pull and merge changes from `main` into your feature branch
* Avoid long-running branches to reduce merge conflicts

---

## 5. Use `.gitignore` Properly

* Exclude files and folders that shouldn‚Äôt be tracked (build files, secrets, IDE configs)
* Use [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) to generate templates for your tech stack

---

## 6. Commit Often and Small

* Commit logically grouped changes
* Avoid massive commits that are hard to review
* Smaller commits make debugging and rollback easier

---

## 7. Tagging and Releases

* Use tags for marking release points
* Follow semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
* Draft GitHub Releases with release notes for transparency

---

## 8. Use Issues to Track Work

* Create issues for bugs, features, tasks
* Label and assign to team members
* Use issue templates for consistency

---

## 9. Protect Important Branches

* Enable branch protection rules on `main` or `master`
* Require PR reviews, status checks, and CI passes before merging
* Prevent force pushes and direct commits on protected branches

---

## 10. Automate with GitHub Actions

* Automate tests, builds, deployments using workflows
* Run checks on PRs to maintain code quality
* Automate release publishing

---

## 11. Documentation

* Maintain a clear README
* Add contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
* Use Wiki or docs folder for detailed project docs

---

## 12. Use SSH for Authentication (Secure)

* Set up SSH keys instead of HTTPS passwords for secure access
* Easier and safer for frequent pushes/pulls

---

## 13. Collaborate Transparently

* Use mentions (`@username`) in comments
* Use projects or milestones to organize work
* Keep communication in PRs and issues clear and respectful
